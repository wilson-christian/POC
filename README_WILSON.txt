-> Details
1) Overview
- Used HTTP & GetX libraries
- GetX is powerful & super easy to use
- All the pages/screens are in routes/app_routes.dart
- Partial MVC pattern is implemented


2) Assumptions
- Data from API is always not null
- The value 'albumId' key is always 1


3) Whatâ€™s Left To Do and Anything Else
- Can integrate local database
- Given update API could be done as well
- Better transition & animation
- Better UI
- The Functions are names nicely so there is less need to write comments


4) Publish the code somewhere and provide us instructions on how to run it build and run it ourselves. Include any database requirements/seed files
- Code uploaded at : https://github.com/wilson-christian/POC
- Public repo & its name is POC so as you mentioned not other candidate could copy it
- Visual Studio Code with flutter setup could run the code easily (Android studio also works)
- For android debug apk you can simply run 'flutter build apk --debug' in cmd inside the project folder
- You can get debug apk at : ...POC\build\app\outputs\apk\debug this location in your computer
- For release APK & IPA you can follow
- APK : https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android
- IPA : https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/ios


5) How do you break the problem down?
- Though its a simple demo where not much logic was needed
- But considering it I could say I work screen-wise
- Meaning took 1 screen 1 feature in it & started working it
- Refactored the code whenever two features got dependent on each other
- Tested well as I worked on each feature.


6) How do you communicate information to others (e.g. build/deploy instructions)?
- Not too much experience here, but I would simply send them text on slack, skype etc.
- As per needed could send email to team
- Could manage it via any tracking software like JIRA
